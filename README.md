# Super20-Program-Practical-Assignment
This is a Super20 Program practical assignment in which I have created an Image Slider.
In this image slider, I have displayed a set of images in a container and have also included navigation buttons (previous and next) to switch between images.There is also a automatic sliding functionality with a pause/play button.
I have applied CSS to style the slider and make it responsive and also included a caption or title for each image.
